# Programming Collective Intelligence - Code Examples

### Description

Code examples from the book [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/) by Toby Segaran. The code examples in the
book are written in Python 2. At the time of reading the book I've used Python 3, so I partially rewrote the code examples in Python 3 syntax. The
code examples for each chapter are located in the corresponding ``chapter`` directory, where also the test/sample data can be found.
